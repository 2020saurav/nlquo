The app is collection of 3 mini-apps. 

* The first one is Location. This takes your geolocation and presents the best guess for the address nearby. This uses Google Maps API. It uses few bytes of data and hence it is extremely fast.

* The second one is News app. This fetches news from some of the websites. Most of the part is done on a remote server and you are sent just the HTML response, so it involves minimal usage of phone data and is extremely fast.

* The third one is Quotes. This works offline, unlike previous two. It has a large collection of inspiring quotes for life. A random quote will be displayed each time.
